**Responsiveness**


#### Testing User Stories 


#### During Development I Fixed The Following Bugs


- I wanted the user to be able to add ingredients and instructions so they would appear on new lines. At first I had the <input> field from Materialize then I changed it to <textarea> and added the class of materialize-textarea so that when a user added an ingredient they could just press enter and next ingredient would appear on a new line.


- Ingredients and Instructions on the recipe card was showing without any linebreaks.
Previous:{{ recipe.category_name }}
Added a for loop with list element so the ingredients/instructions could iterate through:
    {% for ingredient in recipe.ingredients %}
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        {{ ingredient }}
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    {% endfor %} 

- This solves the issue but now all the letters was on a new line.
I added .splitlines() and that problem was solved.

- The different steps for the instructions all have nr 1
