# Yum Yum - Baby Food Recipes

[A live version of the page can be viewed here](https://baby-food.herokuapp.com/home)

![mockup image]()


Yum Yum is a recipe site for baby food. Users can search trough existing recipes and create an account where they can upload and store their own recipes and share them with other users. As a new mom I've realized the importance of finding good and healthy recipes for my kid. I've also realized the importance of finding them fast due to lack of time. This is why I wanted to create this website for me and parents alike that could benefit from this service.


## UX

### The Goals For This Website Is To: 
- Provide a place where people can easily find good and healthy recipes for babies
- Be able to create an account to store your own recipes
- Share baby food recipes with other people
- Make it easy for users to navigate the site on any device 

### User Stories

1. As a user I easily want to find good and healthy recipes that I can make for my baby
2. As a user I want to be able to search for a specific ingredient in the recipes
3. As a user I want to be able to look for recipes sorted by category
4. As a user I want to be able to create my own account
5. As a user I want to upload my own recipes
6. As a user I want to be able to edit my recipes
7. As a user I want to be able to delete my recipes
8. As a user I want to be able to log in to my account
9. As a user I want to be able to log out of my account
10. As a site admin I want to be able to add new categories to the site
11. As a site admin I want to be able to edit categories
12. As a site admin I want to be able to delete categories

### Design 

With a potential user in mind being a parent with restricted time searching for recipes they can make for their babies, I wanted to have a minimalistic design and focus on ways to quick and easy locate what they're looking for. That is way I choose to have the recipes on a card that immidiately shows the recipes when they click on them rather then sending the user to an additional page. This way they can click their way through several recipes to see if it's something that interest them without leaving the main page.  I didn't want to have the classic pastel colors all over the page that you normally see when it's connected to babies and that is way I choose to have a color palette with calm colors that feels a little bit more modern and also has a good contrast ratio. The name Yum Yum is for me a playful way of saying that something is good when you're talking to a baby and also indicates that the website is designed with babies in mind.

#### Typography

The main fonts that I choose for this project is Montserrat and Lato which are two quite simple sans-serif fonts that gives a clean expression and are easy to read. For the name of the website I have used Gluten which is a cursive font with round shapes that fits well with the kids theme. It's also being used for the flash messages to tie the page together. This is a font that I think could feel a little overhelming and unserious if it's used too much so that is way I choose to use it sparingly.

## Features
### Existing Features

- **Navbar** 
    - Each page features a responsive Materialize navbar thatâ€™s collapsed to a burger icon when viewing on smaller screens. The navbar has a hover effect so when the user hovers over the different pages the text changes color. In the left corner there is a logo with a link that takes you to the landing page.
    - Users that are not logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
        - *HOME*
        - *RECIPES*
        - *SIGN UP*
        - *LOG IN* 
    - Users that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
        - *HOME*
        - *RECIPES*
        - *ACCOUNT*
        - *LOG OUT* 
    - Admin that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
        - *HOME*
        - *RECIPES*
        - *ACCOUNT*
        - *MANAGE CATEGORIES*
        - *LOG OUT* 

- **Footer**
        - The footer is displayed on all pages and features links to social media accounts (currently to the main sites for the platforms but will eventually be linked to Yum Yum's social media accounts once they exist)

- **Home** - The landing page features a flat illustration picturing a woman feeding a baby that is sitting in her lap. There is also a call to action button with the text *show recipes* that leads to the page with all the recipes so that users quick and easy can find it.

- **Recipes** 
    The Recipe page features a search bar at the top and below are links to the different categories that the recipes are divided into so you can filter out the category you're intrested in. The recipes are presented in a grid with image cards.
    - **Search bar**
    Allows the user to search for the name of a recipe or an ingredient in the recipe. This will then filter out all the recipes that includes the word that was searched.
    - **Cards**
    On the front the user is provided with an image of the recipe followed by the category and then the name. There is also an hover effect when you move the cursor over the cards to highligt which recipe you're currently on. When you click on the card the recipe is displayed. If you're the user who has uploaded the recipe you also have the possibility to edit or delete it.

- **Account** 
On top of the Account page there is a button to Add a recipe and below is all the recipes uploaded by the user.
    - **Add Recipe**
    As a registered user you can upload your own recipes. To do this you fill in a form that includes:
        - Recipe Category
        - Recipe Name
        - Ingredients
        - Instructions
        - Image

    All fields need to be filled out for the form to be submitted. The recipe is then displayed on the users own account page and on the recipe page.
    - **Edit Recipe**
    You can edit your own recipe. The form is prefilled with the information that you have filled out so it's easy to adjust any changes. 
    - **Delete Recipe**
    You can delete your own recipe. When you click on the delete button a confirmation modal pops up to assure you want to delete the recipe and not doing it accidentally.

- **Sign Up** 
The Sign up page features a simple form where the user can pick a username and a password. A request is made to MongoDB to check if the username is already in use. If it's not being used a profile is created and the user is directed to their account page.

- **Log In**
The log in page also features a simple form  where the user type their username and password to log in to their account. If the user don't exists or make a typo a flash message appears that says "Incorrect Username and/or Password".

- **Manage Categories**
When the Admin is logged in there is a page to manage the categories for the recipes. It's possible to either edit or delete the existing categories or to add new ones.


### Features Left To Implement
- At the moment there's not so many recipes on the website but eventually it will be a lot more and it could become hard to navigate if everything is on one single page and that is why pagination would be a nice feature to have.
- To upload your own images of the recipe instead of an URL.
- To save your favourite recipes
- The possibility for users to delete their own account
- Add more information about the recipes such as allergies, servings, preparation time and so on.
