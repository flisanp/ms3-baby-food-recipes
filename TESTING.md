### During Development I Fixed The Following Bugs

- When a user added the ingredients to the recipes they've appeared on the same line instead of seperate lines which made it difficult to read. The same was for instructions.

<br>

    - I wanted the user to be able to add ingredients and instructions so they all would appear on seperate lines in a list. At first I had the `input` field from Materialize then I changed it to `textarea` and added the class of .materialize-textarea so that when a user added an ingredient or a new step in the instructions they could just press enter to make a line break. I've also added a .helper-text to clearify for the user what to do.


    - I've also added a for loop with list element so the ingredients/instructions could iterate through.
Previous: `{{ recipe.category_name }}`
Changed it to:
    `{% for ingredient in recipe.ingredients %}`
            `<div>`
                `<ul>`
                    `<li>`
                        `{{ ingredient }}`
                    `</li>`
                `</ul>`
            `</div>`
    `{% endfor %}`

- This solved the issue but now all the letters was on a new line.

<br>
    - I added .splitlines() and that the fixed problem.

- The different steps for the instructions all have nr 1.

#### During Development I Fixed The Following Bugs


- I wanted the user to be able to add ingredients and instructions so they would appear on new lines. At first I had the <input> field from Materialize then I changed it to <textarea> and added the class of materialize-textarea so that when a user added an ingredient they could just press enter and next ingredient would appear on a new line.


- Ingredients and Instructions on the recipe card was showing without any linebreaks.
Previous:{{ recipe.category_name }}
Added a for loop with list element so the ingredients/instructions could iterate through:
    {% for ingredient in recipe.ingredients %}
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        {{ ingredient }}
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    {% endfor %} 

- This solves the issue but now all the letters was on a new line.
I added .splitlines() and that problem was solved.

- The instructions all have nr 1 






- Issue with previous info window not closing when clicking on a new marker.
  ![issue markers](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/8a4491fa0c045600c8d1a4bcaa7f92e268c14af0/readme%20assets/bugs/issue-markers.png)

    - I found one error in consol declaring that `infoObj` was not defined.

    - Defined `var infoObj= [];`
    ![not defined solution](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/120ca893eb8fd8569b3f8009ffa2d828cf9aba46/readme%20assets/bugs/not-defined-solution.png)

![menu links overlapping](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/5b2719de928c21d56b34213f628b4a3a61b8b030/readme%20assets/bugs/menu-links-overlapping.png)

 - Added padding to the class `hero-text`

- I had some contrast issues with my design in the beginning. My image and text colors did not work well together.
![contrasting issues](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/8a4491fa0c045600c8d1a4bcaa7f92e268c14af0/readme%20assets/bugs/contrasting-issue.png)
![contrast issues white](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/contrast-issues-white.png)
    - I had to rethink my design and I changed both hero image and text color. I added an overlay on the the image and changed the text color to white and blue but I still got warnings in Wave telling me there were still low contrast between text and background. I found out that they are testing the text against the css background and not the image in case the image isn't loading.
    ![wave test](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/wave.png)
    - I changed the background color with css to a dark blue.

- Got warnings in Wave with contrast issues on my implemented weather forecast that had presets. 
![contrast weathermap](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/contrast-weathermap.png)
    - I had to override the presets by adding !important to css.

#### HTML Testing
https://validator.w3.org/ - No errors or warnings to show.
![html](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/html-valid.png)


#### CSS Testing 
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - showed 2 warnings regarding bootstrap presets.
![css](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/css-valid.png)


#### JS Testing
https://jshint.com/ - showed the following warnings:

![script](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/script-js.png)
![map](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/map-js.png)
![map](https://github.com/flisanp/ms2-barcelona-guide/blob/master/readme%20assets/bugs/map-unused.png)

Warnings regarding *unused variable*: those functions are being called from the HTML file, so within the context of just the js file they are undefined, but they are in use by the HTML file. JShint only validates the JavaScript file and doesn't take into account that functions may be being called from outside the file.

Warning regarding *Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (closeOtherInfo, map, infoObj)*: I will not have the time to solve this semantic warning issue now without breaking  the code. The functionality of the code works despite this so I've decided to keep it like that for the time beeing and fix it in the future.
